- **Generating Data for Offline RAG Evaluation:** Learned to generate evaluation data using different approaches, including OpenAI.
- **Offline RAG Evaluation: Cosine Similarity and ROUGE:** Applied cosine similarity and ROUGE scores to evaluate LLM outputs.
- **LLM as a Judge:** Used LLMs to judge the quality of answers, providing an additional evaluation metric.
- **Capturing User Feedback:** Implemented methods to capture user feedback and integrate it into the system.
- **Monitoring the System:** Set up monitoring tools like Grafana to track various performance metrics and user feedback.

## Practical Experience
- Evaluated the quality of RAG systems using offline metrics like cosine similarity and ROUGE scores.
- Used LLMs as judges to evaluate answer quality.
- Captured and integrated user feedback into the monitoring system.
- Set up monitoring tools to track system performance and visualize metrics.

## Highlights
The highlight of the week was learning to use cosine similarity and ROUGE scores for evaluating the quality of LLM outputs. Setting up monitoring tools to track performance and user feedback was also crucial for ensuring the system's reliability.
